<p>Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development. It contains CSS- and (optionally)
    JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface components.

    Bootstrap is the seventh-most-starred project on GitHub, with more than 142,000 stars,
    behind freeCodeCamp (almost 312,000 stars) and marginally behind Vue.js framework.[2] According to Alexa Rank,
    Bootstrap is in the top-2000 in the USA while vuejs.org is in the top-7000 in the USA.[3]
    Bootstrap, originally named Twitter Blueprint, was developed by Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton at Twitter as a framework to
    encourage consistency across internal tools. Before Bootstrap, various libraries were used for interface development, which led to
    inconsistencies and a high maintenance burden. According to Twitter developer Mark Otto:

    A super small group of developers and I got together to design and build a new internal tool and saw an opportunity to
    do something more. Through that process, we saw ourselves build something much more substantial than another internal tool.
    Months later, we ended up with an early
    version of Bootstrap as a way to document and share common design patterns and assets within the company.[4]
